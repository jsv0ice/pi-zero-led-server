# pi-zero-led-server
This is my implementation of a simple flask server that controls an RGB LED strip via a raspberry pi zero. 

This is adapted for the WS2811 series of LED RGB strips. The library I'm using supports quite a few, but its configured for my specific strip. If you'd like to contribute additional configurations, you're welcome to!
